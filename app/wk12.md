# Login page

The feature is about having a login/sign up page before accessing the BookStore app

When the user enters the app for the first time, they will have no way to login since they have not saved
a username and password yet. So, they will have to sign up first. After signing up, they will see a toast
that their login credentials have been saved. Then they will have to enter the same credentials and press
login after entering correct credentials and they will be entered into the BookList page.

At the moment, there are two EditTextViews for username and password and two Buttons for login and sign up.
The application uses SharedPreferences to store the username and password.

It also uses Toast messages to display informative messages to the user such as "Login Successful" or
"Incorrect Credentials", etc

Note that we use finish() in the login function because we do not want the user to go back to the login
page
